PARALLAX SCROLLING & SPACING TUNING TASK
=========================================

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- Next.js 14 app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Home page located at: src/app/page.tsx
- All parallax parameters centralized at: src/config/parallaxConfig.ts
- Uses ScrollReveal component for fade/slide animations
- Uses CenterFocusReveal component for parallax + center-focus fade effects

CURRENT STATE:
The parallax and spacing parameters have been set up but need fine-tuning. The values are close but not quite right - the animations feel off, spacing might be too tight or too loose, and the overall scroll experience needs refinement.

TASK:
Your sole focus is to dial in the parallax scrolling and element spacing parameters to create a polished, professional feel. Adjust values incrementally and test in the browser frequently.

KEY FILES TO EDIT:
- src/config/parallaxConfig.ts - All parallax parameters are here (ScrollReveal, CenterFocusReveal, layout spacing)
- src/components/CenterFocusReveal.tsx - Component that handles center-focus parallax (has internal fade parameters)

WHAT TO ADJUST:

1. ScrollReveal Parameters (for About, Contact sections):
   - distance: How far elements move during reveal (pixels)
   - delay: Animation start delay (milliseconds)
   - threshold: How much must be visible to trigger (0-1)
   - rootMargin: Trigger zone around viewport (px string)

2. CenterFocusReveal Parallax Speed (for Services & Projects items):
   - services.speed: Parallax multiplier (0.1-0.5 range)
   - projects speeds: Individual speeds per project (currently 0.2, 0.25, 0.3)

3. Layout Spacing:
   - itemGap: Vertical spacing between items ('35vh' to '60vh')
   - stickyHeaderTop: Where sticky headers position ('10vh' to '40vh')
   - headerColumnWidth: Grid column width ('150px' to '300px')

4. CenterFocusReveal Internal Parameters (in component file):
   - maxDistance multiplier: When items start fading (viewportHeight * 0.25 currently)
   - translateY amount: Vertical movement during fade (currently 60px)

CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS:
- Smooth, professional scroll experience
- Elements fade in/out gracefully without jarring transitions
- Proper spacing - items should be visible one at a time with previous/next fading out
- Sticky headers positioned well - visible but not interfering with content
- Parallax effect is subtle and adds depth without being distracting
- Consistent feel across Services and Projects sections

APPROACH:
1. Start with the config file (parallaxConfig.ts) - adjust values incrementally (small changes: 0.05-0.1 for speeds, 5-10px for distances, 5vh for spacing)
2. Test each change in browser - scroll slowly to observe the effect
3. If needed, adjust CenterFocusReveal.tsx internal fade parameters (maxDistance, translateY)
4. Document what works - note final values that feel right
5. Iterate until the scroll experience feels polished and professional

CURRENT VALUES (as reference - adjust these):
- About: distance: 100, delay: 300, threshold: 0.4, rootMargin: '20px'
- Contact: distance: 80, delay: 200
- Services speed: 0.5
- Projects speeds: 0.2, 0.25, 0.3
- itemGap: '40vh'
- stickyHeaderTop: '10vh'
- headerColumnWidth: '200px'

NOTES:
- The config file has helpful comments explaining each parameter
- Values are currently too dramatic/not quite right - needs refinement
- Focus on subtle, professional animations
- Test on actual scroll behavior, not just initial load

GOAL:
Create a polished, professional parallax scroll experience where elements gracefully appear and fade, spacing feels natural, and the overall effect enhances rather than distracts from the content.
