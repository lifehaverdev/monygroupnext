About Page Creation Prompt
==========================

Context
-------
Project: **monygroupnext** (Next.js 14, React Server Components, Tailwind, Three.js).  An "About" route exists (`src/app/about/page.tsx`) but contains only placeholder text.  We need a compelling, on-brand page that blends narrative copy, visuals, and interactive flourishes without harming performance.

High-level narrative
--------------------
Mony Group is a boutique studio crafting "liquid-glass" web experiences—sleek, kinetic, and immersive.  The About page should convey our mission, values, team personality, and technical prowess.

Objectives
----------
1. Produce rich content sections (copy + component wireframes) matching this outline:
   A. Hero – impactful headline, subtle glass morphing WebGL background.
   B. Core Values – 3-4 value cards with iconography.
   C. Team – photo grid with hover reveals; optional fun facts.
   D. Timeline – milestone list with animated reveal on scroll.
   E. Tech Stack – interactive carousel or grid of logos with blurbs.
   F. Press & Recognition – external logos, lighthouse badges, etc.
   G. CTA Footer – “Let’s create something fluid together” with email button.
2. Supply placeholder copy for each section, ready for client polish.
3. Specify component breakdown and file structure (e.g. `components/about/Hero.tsx`).
4. Note performance considerations (lazy-load heavy assets, memoize shaders, etc.).
5. Provide Tailwind class suggestions but avoid hard-coding design tokens; reference CSS variables where possible.

Implementation guidance
----------------------
• Use React Server Components when static; client components only for interactive bits (carousel, WebGL hero).
• Leverage existing `ThreeScene` util for glass shader; allow prop overrides.
• Keep initial CLS minimal—defer heavy Three.js imports with `dynamic(import…, { ssr: false, loading: … })`.
• Ensure accessibility: alt text for images, reduced-motion fallbacks.

Deliverables
------------
1. Markdown spec (`about-page-spec.md`) summarizing section hierarchy and copy.
2. Starter component files scaffolding with TODO comments.
3. Any new assets saved under `public/about/`.

QA checklist
------------
☐ Page loads ≤ 2 s on 3G simulated.
☐ All images lazy-load with `loading="lazy"`.
☐ Keyboard navigation covers all interactive elements.
☐ Lighthouse scores ≥ 95 across the board.
